This portfolio contains different applications of programming and web development.
## Websites
### Guitar Gods Website
The Guitar Gods Website is a small 3 page website that loads data from a database using SQLite and loops through data to show you different guitarists using JavaScript.
It is a simple website that was one of the first websites that I ever made.
### Evangelion Database
This website deals with characters and mechs from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, it is a fun little project that I did for a class in college and really shows that I improved overtime as this website uses Razor Pages and introduces C# into the mix.
### Todo Application
This is a website that incorporates different technologies like MongoDB and AngularJS, this was a fun little school project that tested whether or not we could take our previous learnings and incorporate them with simular technologies but not entirely the same technologies.
### Mailroom Application
This website really tested my knowledge of websites and also introduced three-tier architecture as I used .NET MVC to configure this website.
